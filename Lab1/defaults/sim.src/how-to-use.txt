Help for the CISE Network Simulator
-----------------------------------

How to use:
-----------

* First, load the config file. This can be done by File/Load or
  by putting the config file at the command line of this program.
  Use "Run/Run" to start running. 
  
  To send one or more messages, type in the messages in the text 
  window. Press "Send Msg" button.

  To send a graph, "Load Graph" first and then "Send Graph." Or if
  you are as lazy as I am, just press "Send Graph" and it'll load
  the graph and start running.

  Change the delay to make it run faster/slower. Use "Run/Single step"
  and space bar to see it step by step.

  Change Debug Level (from 0~3) and use dprintf() in your program
  to print out debug information. 

Selections in Menu:
-------------------

  File: Load	    -- load config file
	Exit 	    -- stop the program
  Edit: Raise	    -- raise the node graphs and space-time diagrams
		       to the front of main window. Useful when you
		       cannot see the graphs.
  Run:  Run	    -- Start the simulator. You need to send msg/graph
		       to see further animation.
	Single Step -- Enters single step mode. Use <space> bar
		       for a step.
	Pause	    -- Pause the simulation.
	Resume      -- Resume the simulation.
	Delay       -- set delay between events. The default is 50. 
		       5 is pretty fast. Set to 1, it will run so fast
		       that you may temporarily lose control over it.
	Stop Time   -- The simulation time to stop.
	Inc/Dec Debug Level -- Increament/Decrement Debug Level, which
		       is used in dprintf().
  Help: About       -- About CISE Project.
	How to use  -- This help.

Status Bar: (at the bottom)
-----------
  Filename:	The config file name.
  Stop Time:	The simulated time to stop.
  Delay:	Delay between events.
  DebugLevel:	DebugLevel used in dprintf().
  Simulation time: The clock in the simulator.

In each node graph:
------------------
  Send msg:	send msg in the text window
  Send graph:	send the graph in the graph window
  Clear msg:    clear the text window
  Clear graph:  clear the graph window
  Load graph:   load a pre-defined graph

Known Bugs:
-----------
* If you put the Simulator window in the background and 
  then bring it to foreground, you may see some bad graphics.
